# Android Permissions

## About The Project

This is a simple Kotlin project that is used to better understand how App permissions work within Android, using both the camera and GPS permissions.

Permission i requested for the camera and the GPS functionality, by using a Button together with a click listener within a ConstraintLayout.

App permissions help support user privacy by protecting access to the following:

- **Restricted data**, such as system state and a user's contact information.
- **Restricted actions**, such as connecting to a paired device and recording audio.

This project looks at runtime permissions that require a request for permission to be made at runtime.

The [Google Permissions Developer Docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) indicate the following workflow for app permissions:
